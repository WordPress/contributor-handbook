# Contributor Handbook
This repository will manage the Pathways project in the [WordPress Contributor Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/).  At this time we are not managing other pages through Github.

## Status
🚧 **Work in progress** — We're currently migrating content and setting up sync.

## Contributing
Contributing guidelines coming soon. For now, please hold off on PRs until sync is active.
