# Make WordPress â€“ Contributor Handbook

This repo is dedicated to the overarching Make WordPress Contributor Handbook which is located at [https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/)

Initially [proposed in March 2021](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/03/16/proposal-a-wordpress-project-contributor-handbook/) by Exexutive Director of the WordPress project Josepha Hayden-Chomphosy. During the CloudFest Hackathon March 2024 members of the global WordPress DEIB working group commited to update and expand the initial content.

## Objective

The objective of this Contributor Handbook is to provide guidance and resources for individuals who wish to contribute to our beloved open-source project. 

This handbook aims to give easy access to foundational content and a birds-eye view of the global WordPress project.

## Get Involved

For discussion, questions and meetings, please join the WordPress [#DEIB-working-group](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C05ND1KPW0Y) Slack channel. Join the text-based Meetings every other week on Friday at 1pm UTC.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Phase 0: Create an initial structure to understand the categorization.
- [ ] Phase 1: Create the empty-files with a link inside, so there is all the structure.
- [ ] Phase 2: Add the content (only copying from the original page and create the content structure).
- [ ] Phase 3: Publish a first updated version of the Contributor Handbook.
- [ ] Phase 4: Check and improve the content.
