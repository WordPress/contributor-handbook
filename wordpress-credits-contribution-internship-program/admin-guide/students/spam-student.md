# Spam Student

When a Spam student account is created that does not belong to the University it claims to belong, we follow these steps:

* Delete that student row from the ‘Students Reports’ table.  
* Delete that student row from the ‘Feedback’ table.  
* Mark it as SPAM in the ‘status’ column from the Students table
