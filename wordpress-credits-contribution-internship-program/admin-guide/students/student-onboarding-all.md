# Student Onboarding (ALL)

These are the last onboarding steps:

## [**Step 1: Welcome Email to the Course**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/admin-guide/students/student-onboarding-all/#step-1-welcome-email-to-the-course)

When the student in the “Students” table match these conditions:

1. **Full Name** is not empty  
2. **Email** is not empty  
3. **Educational** Institutions is not empty  
4. **Status** is **In Sensei**  
5. **Mentor** is not empty  
* The automation [“Add students to Students Reports and Feedback”](https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/wflXg1xFuiCSG0pXZ) creates a record for the student in ‘Students Reports’ and ‘Feedback’.  
* The automation [“Email – \[EN\] – Student Welcome Email”](https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/wflFkVNm8tTIBZ839) sends the welcome email with the mentor and education@wordpressfoundation.org in copy. That email includes step-by-step instructions to start and their personal link to complete their Student Reports table (here are the [animated instructions on how that works with Fillout from the student point of view](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mc1oNe-IGzzGUTPF4SjvWp_1QK6pgttGt9mRdxQ4P-8/edit?tab=t.0)).
