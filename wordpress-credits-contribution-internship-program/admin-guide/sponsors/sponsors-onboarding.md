Thank you very much for your generous support and for choosing to sponsor one or more mentors in the WordPress Credits Program. We truly appreciate your commitment to empowering the next generation of WordPress contributors.

To move forward, please ask your sponsored mentor(s) to complete our [Call for Mentors Form](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/call-for-mentors/) as soon as possible so we can begin their onboarding process. For convenience, here’s the [direct link to the form](https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/shrFUiCzMP8zwrouL) as well.

When filling out the form, we kindly ask that they indicate your company’s name as their sponsor, so we can correctly link their application.

Once the form has been submitted, mentors will receive a confirmation email followed by additional instructions within a few days. Their next step will be to complete a short, easy Mentor Course designed to help them get familiar with the program and its processes.

If you have any questions or need assistance at any stage, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

* It is **useful** for our students  
* It is a **free** service to students that otherwise would be paid.  
* In case of doubts, check with the admin team or just inform them if the decision is clear.

If it is legit, reply to them with the positive answer and update the following **only after the mentors has become active**:

* The offer description table of the last lesson of the onboarding module ([create your website](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson/create-your-personal-website/)).  
* The offer description table of the [course main page](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/wordpress-credits/) and [handbook main page](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/).  
* The logo in the sponsors area of the [course main page](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/wordpress-credits/), [handbook main page](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/), and the [official website](https://wordpress.org/education/credits/) (for now this should be asked to Isotta Peira every Thursday or sooner in the week).

If it is not legit, reply explaining the negative answer regarding the tools, giving them the chance to improve their offer if they wish and follow their reply back.
