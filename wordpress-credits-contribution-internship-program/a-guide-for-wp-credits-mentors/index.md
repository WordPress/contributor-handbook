# Mentor Guide

Welcome to the WP Credits mentorship program\! Your role is crucial, you’re not just a guide but a catalyst for the next generation of WordPress contributors. Based on firsthand experience, here are some key insights and practical tips to help you excel and make a lasting impact.

## [**1\. The Power of Consistent Communication**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/#1-the-power-of-consistent-communication)

* **The Challenge**: Students can feel isolated or lose momentum without regular check-ins. Asynchronous communication (like emails or messages) is essential, but it’s often not enough to build rapport and address complex issues.

* **The Tip**: Schedule a Weekly Call. Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine. This dedicated time serves multiple purposes:

* **Builds Trust**: A regular voice or video call creates a stronger personal connection than text alone.

* **Solves Blockers Quickly**: It’s the perfect forum for students to ask questions that are difficult to articulate in writing. You can use screen-sharing to troubleshoot problems in real-time.

* **Maintains Momentum**: Knowing there’s a weekly touchpoint keeps students accountable and motivated to progress on their tasks.

## [**2\. Setting Clear Expectations from Day One**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/#2-setting-clear-expectations-from-day-one)

* **The Challenge**: Ambiguity is the enemy of progress. Students may be new to open-source workflows, project management tools, or the specific tasks they’re assigned. Unclear instructions lead to confusion, delays, and frustration.

* **The Tip**: Over-Explain and Document.

* **Break It Down**: Don’t just assign a task; explain why it’s important, what the final outcome should look like, and where to find resources.

* **Define “Done”**: Clearly outline the criteria for a task to be considered complete. Does it need a code review? A pull request? A published post?

* **Provide Examples**: Share links to exemplary tickets, well-written commit messages, or past student work. A good example is worth a thousand words.

## [**3\. Unlocking Potential by Understanding Aptitudes**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/#3-unlocking-potential-by-understanding-aptitudes)

* **The Challenge**: Students have diverse backgrounds, skills, and learning paces. A one-size-fits-all approach can leave some bored and others overwhelmed.

* **The Tip**: Be a Detective and a Coach.

* **Assess Early**: In your first calls, ask about their previous experience with coding, design, writing, or project management. Give them small, varied tasks to see what they enjoy and excel at.

* **Play to Their Strengths**: Once you identify a student’s aptitude (e.g., front-end development, documentation, QA testing), you can tailor tasks to fit their skills and interests, which dramatically increases engagement and quality of work.

* **Challenge Them Appropriately**: The goal is growth. Assign tasks that stretch their abilities without breaking their confidence.

## [**4\. Mastering the Art of Time Management**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/#4-mastering-the-art-of-time-management)

* **The Challenge**: Students juggle multiple commitments. It’s easy for them to underestimate a task’s complexity or procrastinate, risking project deadlines.

* **The Tip**: Be a Proactive Timekeeper.

* **Estimate Together**: When assigning a task, ask the student to estimate how long they think it will take. Compare it with your own estimate and discuss any discrepancies. This teaches them valuable project scoping skills.

* **Set Mini-Deadlines**: Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks with their own due dates. This makes progress more measurable and prevents last-minute rushes.

* **Check In Between Calls**: A simple mid-week message (“How is task X going? Any blockers?”) shows you’re engaged and helps you identify time-related issues early.

* **In Summary**: Embrace the Teacher Mindset

Ultimately, being a great mentor in the WP Credits program means embracing the role of a teacher. It’s about more than just providing answers; it’s about fostering understanding, encouraging problem-solving, and nurturing a student’s professional growth. Your patience, clarity, and active investment in their journey will be the most significant factors in their success, and the success of the entire program.
