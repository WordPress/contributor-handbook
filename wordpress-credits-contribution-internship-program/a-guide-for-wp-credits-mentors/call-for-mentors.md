# Call for Mentors

We’re looking for dedicated mentors to guide the next generation of contributors in **WordPress Credits**, a flagship educational program of the WordPress Foundation.

WordPress Credits connects university students with real-world, open-source contribution opportunities. Over 150+ hours, students learn how to collaborate in distributed teams, work on meaningful projects, and gain valuable skills that bridge academia and professional pathways.

Learn more about the program and the mentor role: [WordPress Credits Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/) and [Mentor Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/).

## [**Mentor Requirements**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/call-for-mentors/#mentor-requirements)

* Minimum **2 hours per week** available for the entire duration of the program (current cohorts last **13 to 18 weeks** but it may vary)  
* Availability to **sync once a week with students**  
* Ability to provide **asynchronous support** (Slack, email, or other tools)  
* Commitment to provide a **meaningful mentorship experience**

## [**Mentor Responsibilities**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/call-for-mentors/#mentor-responsibilities)

* Support students in understanding contribution tasks and navigating the WordPress community  
* Encourage collaboration, accountability, and skill growth

## [**Additional Information**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/a-guide-for-wp-credits-mentors/call-for-mentors/#additional-information)

* Mentors will be **vetted** before selection. You will receive an acceptance or rejection email after review.  
* Currently, we are onboarding students from a limited number of institutions. However, we want to **prepare a pool of mentors worldwide** so we can match you with students as soon as more universities join the program.  
* Your mentorship will help students connect their academic learning to real-world practice, while shaping the next wave of WordPress contributors.

Ultimately, being a great mentor in the WP Credits program means embracing the role of a teacher. It’s about more than just providing answers; it’s about fostering understanding, encouraging problem-solving, and nurturing a student’s professional growth. Your patience, clarity, and active investment in their journey will be the most significant factors in their success, and the success of the entire program.
