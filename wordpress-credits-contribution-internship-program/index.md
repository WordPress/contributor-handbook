# WordPress Credits: Contribution Program for Students

**WordPress Credits** is a contribution-based practice program by the WordPress Foundation that brings students into the heart of the WordPress open source project. The program helps students develop transferable skills, gain practical experience, and join a global community of open source contributors.

Through the program, students collaborate with volunteers and professionals from companies in the WordPress ecosystem. While we encourage connections that could lead to paid opportunities, the program itself does not offer compensation.

## [**What Is the Program?**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/#what-is-the-program)

WordPress Credits is designed to help students gain real-world experience contributing to WordPress, while fulfilling academic requirements. The program offers:

* Structured onboarding  
* Mentorship by experienced contributors  
* Hands-on, personalized contribution projects  
* Public visibility of all contributions  
* Flexible arrangements with educational institutions around the world

The program was launched in partnership with the University of Pisa and announced on stage at WordCamp Europe 2025\. Since then, it has received growing interest from students, academic institutions, and companies across the WordPress ecosystem.

## [**Who Can Join?**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/#who-can-join)

The program is open to:

* Students from all fields of study  
* Educational institutions interested in integrating open source contribution into their academic curriculum  
* Companies and sponsors interested in supporting student learning and mentorship

## [**Partner Institutions**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/#partner-institutions)

WordPress Credits is made possible thanks to the collaboration of forward-thinking institutions that recognize the value of open source education. Together, we are bridging academia and real-world contribution by integrating WordPress into academic programs and traineeship pathways.

Our current partners include, in order of affiliation date:

* **University of Pisa** (Pisa, Italy)  
* **Fidélitas University** (San José, Costa Rica)  
* **Franz Tamayo University (Unifranz)** (Santa Cruz – Cochabamba, Bolivia)  
* **Riga Nordic University** (Riga, Latvia)  
* **Ahmad’s Education** (Dhaka, Bangladesh)  
* **Krakow University of Economics** (Krakow, Poland)  
* **Cracow University of Technology** (Krakow, Poland)  
* **Central New Mexico Community College** (Albuquerque, New Mexico, US)  
* **IES Azarquiel** (Toledo, Spain)

Each institution plays a key role in helping students gain hands-on experience, develop professional skills, and contribute to one of the world’s most influential open source projects.

## [**Program Structure**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/#program-structure)

The program can run for an academic semester (typically 3–4 months) or follow flexible formats based on the institution’s requirements. For example, the University of Pisa allows year-round participation with a contribution goal of 150 hours.

Each program includes three main phases. Below is an example from the pilot program with the University of Pisa, where students complete 150 hours of contributions over 15 weeks, averaging 10 hours per week:

## [**Why It Matters**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/#why-it-matters)

WordPress Credits lowers the barriers to open source contribution, supports the academic and professional development of students, and helps build a diverse, sustainable contributor pipeline for the WordPress project.

By welcoming students, mentors, sponsors, and volunteers into this initiative, we are shaping not only the future of WordPress, but the future of open source itself.
