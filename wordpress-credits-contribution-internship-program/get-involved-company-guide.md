# Sponsor Guide

## [**Support the Next Generation of WordPress Contributors**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/get-involved-company-guide/#support-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-contributors)

The WordPress Credits internship program connects university students with meaningful opportunities to collaborate on real-world WordPress projects. Through hands-on experience, they strengthen existing skills, develop new ones, and gain insight into professional open source practices, all while bringing fresh energy and perspectives to the community.

We’re inviting companies in the WordPress ecosystem to support this initiative and help shape the future of open source.

### [**How Your Company Can Contribute**](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/get-involved-company-guide/#how-your-company-can-contribute)

The most impactful contribution to WordPress Credits is mentorship, as mentors guide and empower students throughout their first open source experience. For this reason, sponsors can choose to support the program by sponsoring one or multiple mentors, sponsoring mentors while also offering tools that help students contribute effectively and feel confident in their work, or by proposing an alternative type of sponsorship aligned with the program’s mission.

Examples of alternative sponsorships include funding a scholarship program to help students attend flagship WordPress events, sponsoring a program admin to strengthen coordination and support, or providing in-kind sponsorships to cover the costs of the tools used to manage and improve the program experience.

We are happy to discuss the various ways your company can contribute. Together, we can build a stronger and more sustainable open source future.

Beyond direct sponsorship, individual community members can also support WordPress Credits by sharing this announcement, volunteering to help review student work, or offering to speak to student cohorts about their experiences in the WordPress ecosystem.

There are several ways your organization can support WP Credits:

* **Sponsor a Mentor**  
  Dedicate one or multiple team members to guide student contributors for a few hours per week. Depending on their availability, a single mentor can support multiple students at a time while still providing dedicated and thoughtful guidance, helping them navigate open source collaboration and project work. If you’d like to sponsor a mentor external to your company, please let us know and we’ll connect you with the mentors who are looking for sponsorship.  
* **Sponsor a Mentor \+ Tools and Resources**  
  These may include tools and resources such as hosting plans, domain names, premium plugins or themes, collaboration platforms, or design and development software. Anything that helps students contribute effectively and feel empowered in their work is welcome.  
* **Other**  
  * **Sponsor an Admin**  
    Support a member of the program’s admin team who is responsible for building, maintaining, improving, and growing the initiative. Their work ensures smooth operations, meaningful learning experiences for students, and long-term program sustainability.  
  * **Provide In-kind Sponsorship**  
    Help cover essential program expenses such as tools and collaboration platforms. This investment creates real-world connection points and lasting engagement with the community.  
  * **Fund a Scholarship**  
    Financial contributions help fund travel and attendance for the most active students at WordPress flagship events.

We’re happy to discuss the level of involvement that best fits your company’s capacity. Together, we can strengthen the WordPress project and empower the next generation of contributors.
