## **What is WordPress Credits?**

WordPress Credits is an educational program of the **WordPress Foundation**. It gives students the opportunity to practice their skills in a real, global, open-source environment. Over the course of **150 hours** (typically 13 to 18 weeks), you’ll contribute to WordPress projects, guided by an experienced mentor, while learning how to collaborate in a distributed team.

WordPress Credits is open to students

### **What to Expect**

* **Mentorship**  
  You’ll be paired with a mentor who will guide you throughout the program. Mentors will meet with you once per week and provide asynchronous support (via Slack or other communication channels).  
* **Time Commitment**  
  The program requires at least **150 hours** (flexible to meet each institution's needs). This usually means about **8–12 hours per week**, depending on the program length (13–18 weeks). You can spread your hours flexibly, but you are expected to stay consistent. The program includes a theoretical onboarding phase and hands-on, practical activities.  
* **Projects**  
  You’ll design and carry out a contribution project aligned with your studies and interests. Projects can involve many areas of WordPress, from community and events, to education, documentation, accessibility, and more.  
* **Community Involvement**  
  You’ll join the [WordPress.org Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/), attend team meetings when possible, and interact with global contributors. This is a chance to build connections and learn how an open-source community works.  
* **Deliverables**  
  * Weekly updates on your project (usually published on your personal WordPress site)  
  * A final presentation and wrap-up post about your journey and outcomes  
  * Contribution credits in the WordPress ecosystem

### **What we mean by contributing to WordPress**

Contributing to WordPress means taking part in a global open-source project where everyone can play a role. It is not limited to writing code: there are many ways to contribute based on individual interests and abilities.

Through the WordPress Credits program, you will discover that contribution is about engaging with the official teams that support the project. For example:

* **Core** team develop and maintain the WordPress software itself, improving performance, fixing bugs, and introducing new features that keep the platform stable and modern.  
* **Polyglots** work on translations, making WordPress available in different languages.  
* **Documentation** team review and improve guides, ensuring instructions remain accurate and clear.  
* **Support** team answer questions in the forums, helping users solve problems.  
* **Community** team organize local events and meetups, showing how collaboration helps projects grow. That’s the team behind the WordPress Credits project.  
* **Training** create learning materials for learn.wordpress.org, turning knowledge into shared resources.

These activities are essential to WordPress. By contributing, you will learn to collaborate with people from different backgrounds, practice communication, and understand how projects are organized on a global scale.

Contributing does not require building a plugin or fixing code. It means choosing a team, learning how it works, and dedicating time to support its goals. This is a practical way to gain experience and develop skills that are useful both inside and outside the WordPress community.

### **Your Responsibilities**

* Dedicate the required time and stay consistent with your contributions  
* Communicate proactively with your mentor and team members  
* Share progress updates regularly  
* Respect the community’s [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/)  
* Approach challenges with curiosity, responsibility, and openness

### **What You’ll Gain**

By the end of the program, you will:

* Gain hands-on experience in **open-source collaboration**  
* Build **technical and professional skills** like project management, communication, problem solving, and teamwork  
* Connect with mentors, peers, and professionals in the WordPress ecosystem  
* Create a portfolio of contributions you can showcase in your career path
